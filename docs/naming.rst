========================
Compound names
========================

There are several ways in which one can define the name of a given material and/or chemical compound. In the HybriD\ :sup:`3` database, our objective is to support as many searchable alternative names as possible for a given compound, mapping (where possible) community conventions.

Definition of a "material"
--------------------------

We generally define a "material" as a single-phase chemical compound, that is, a material that can be made homogeneously beginning from the atomic scale. Composite materials with separate phases at a scale larger than the scale of a few nanometers would thus be defined as two separate materials. However, in hybrid organic-inorganic semiconductors, structural units can be large and the difference between a single-phase material and two separate materials in a composite can be somewhat undefined. Where necessary (e.g., for so called quasi-twodimensional hybrid perovskites or "2.5D" hybrid perovskites), well-defined "materials" that are nanostructured will be included in the database pragmatically.
