===============================================================
Welcome to the documentation of the HybriD\ :sup:`3` database.
===============================================================

Many of the quantities in the HybriD\ :sup:`3` database are (hopefully) self-explanatory and/or defined with specificity in the references provided along with individual data sets. In the present documentation, we attempt to define some of our general choices and definitions in the database. This more formal documentation attempt has been initiated only recently (June 2021) and is a work in progress. Please contact us with any questions if they are not answered here.
